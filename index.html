						<h2>The Problem</h2>
					</header>
					<div class="content">
						<p><strong>Wilfrid Laurier requires an indoor building map application for the campus</strong> Our team will be exploring various platforms to build an indoor building map. The application must offer the functionality required which are an indoor tracking capability, lowest time to build, and intuitivity/ interactivity.</p>
						<p> Here is the the Problem Statement:
						<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
							<li><strong>Ideal</strong>:  Visitors arriving in the Arts Building at Wilfrid Laurier building knowing their whereabouts and can make an educated decision for themselves about how to get to where they need to go.</li>
							<li><strong> Reality </strong>: Not all visitors are familiar with the building and map service/directory may be insufficient and has low accessibility.</li>
							<li><strong>Consequences</strong>:Visitors may be lost and not able to reach their destination efficiently.</li>
							<li><strong>Proposal</strong>: Develop a online indoor map directory of the Arts Building that shows the layout of each floor and all of the rooms on that floor.</li>

						<h2>Introduction</h2>
					</header>
					<div class="content">
						<p>It is challenging to find a way to your destination in Wilfrid Laurier University (WLU) Waterloo campus, especially for special constable 
						   officers that need to get to their destination as soon as possible. The locations of buildings are often unclear, some entrances and exits might be very well hidden 
						   or simply does not have one. Even the directions inside a building could be confusing due to insufficient of 
						   directory signs and indoor maps. A clear indoor map that could access anytime and anywhere would be a helpful 
						   solution for this problem.  The purpose of this project is experimenting various Esri product 
						   to evaluate their performance and suitability as a indoor map implementation for special constable officers. 
						   The WLU Arts Building would be the example of test subject in this project.</p>

						<h3> <u>Indoor Tracking </u></h3>
					<p> Field map allows developers to adjust the GPS accuracy, therefore it should able to provide a higher positioning accuracy than other Esri products.

						<h3>ArcGIS Field map</h3>
							<h3>Pros</h3>

						<h2>Conclusion</h2>
							
						<p><strong> As a indoor map service, Field map has many nice-to-have features such as higher positioning accuracy, offline capability
									and data collecting capability. However it lacks the core feature for indoor mapping service, which is data query,
								    i.e. room searching feature. For special constable officers, a querying function is a higher priority for indoor mapping service,
									this gives Field map a slight disadvantage compare to other Esri product that has data query 
								    feature, such as Experience Builder.  </strong></p>

							<h2>Overall Conclusion</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
						
						<p> After testing each software and evaluating their performance, there is no clear answer of which Esri product is most suitable for 
							implementing indoor maps. Experience Builder has the most interactivity with user, easiest to use and a very useful querying feature, however it 
						    does not have a proper mobile app and it does not work well under offline environment. Nevertheless, this iissue could be solved by the assist
							from dispatcher who has internet access all the time.    Despite the other two product, ArcGIS Workforce and ArcGIS Fieldmap has 
							mobile app and even offline capability, it lack of the data query ability, which is critical for any user who is not familiar with the campus.
						    Overall, Experience Builder has the most advantage for implementing indoor mapping service, but more exploration and research is suggested.  </p>
